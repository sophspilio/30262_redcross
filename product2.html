    <p>Below you will find a web map of past hurricane relief projects American Red Cross has engaged in over the past decade. By clicking on a hurricane symbol, you will be given information on the timeline, response, and finances of ARC's relief
      efforts. The hurricane symbols are located near where each made landfall in the United States and represent the area of first response for ARC. In subsequent months and years, ARC has assisted families and individuals in long-term recovery
      through consistent check-ins, construction and repair assistance, provision of mental health resources, and awarding of recovery grants.</p>

  <!-- Add information about the Prototype -->
  <div>
    <p style="font-weight:600; font-size:25px; width: 1000px">The Prototype</p>
    <p>The prototype for Product 2 is an interactive web map of past ARC hurricane relief projects. This prototype was created using <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gljs">Mapbox GL JS</a>, a <a
        href="https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/">JavaScript library</a> that uses WebGL and Mapbox functionality in tandem to display interactive web maps with vector tiles and custom Mapbox styles. Mapbox was chosen to create this particular
      product because it can be used to produced clean and attractive web maps with interactive content, particularly useful capabilities for a public-facing map. The ability to customize the basemap and corresponding feature icons is additionally
      advantageous to ARC if they planned to expand the purpose of this map to include all of their disaster relief work across the United States, from wildfires to floods to hurricanes. All Mapbox products begin with a free tier that would allow ARC
      to explore the potential of web maps for branding and communicating their work. Beyond free use, Mapbox scales the price of usage based on volume of traffic to a site meaning that the price would increase the more the map is shared and viewed.
      Despite the cost, Mapbox understands the impact of their platform and exercises generosity with partner organizations.</p>
    <p>The Javascript used to build the web map makes use of a Mapbox Impact tool called <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/impact-tools/sheet-mapper">Sheet Mapper</a>, which utilizes the set of functions within <a
        href="https://github.com/mapbox/csv2geojson">csv2geojson</a> to parse a Google Sheet or CSV file to derive a GeoJSON FeatureCollection object for use in a web map. The workflow makes use of latitude and longitude fields in the rows of a
      Google Sheet or CSV file to generate spatial data. Sheet Mapper is a blueprint for organizations that would like to map data from a CSV or Google Sheet to display shelters, events, offices, and more, and was chosen specifically for this reason.
      As a large non-governmental organization focused on on-the-ground work and direct assistance, ARC may not have the technical capacity for more complex spatial data collection beyond the creation of a spreadsheet. Furthermore, the use of a
      Google Sheet to generate and manage this data means that the data can be shared within the organization and widely contributed to.</p>
    <p>The last tool the product makes use of is the <a href="https://jquery.com/">JQuery JavaScript library</a> which adds functionality and interactiveity to the map through pop-ups. This way when a user clicks on a hurricane point, they receive
      information about the particular work ARC conducted in the area in response to the disaster. The addition of the pop-up further allows ARC to add a link to their page with more in depth information about their disaster response and relief work.
      This channels traffic toward the ARC site, where the public may be more inclined to donate after seeing a demonstration of what their money would go toward.</p>
    <p>The intention of this prototype is display where ARC is working on <a href="https://www.redcross.org/about-us/our-work/disaster-relief/hurricane-relief.html">hurricane relief projects</a> throughout the United States in a manner that
      emphasizes the priorities of the organization - namely, helping as many individuals as possible through disaster relief. By displaying information about amount of people help, dollars raised and spent, and relief items distributed, the maps
      turns data collected by the organization into a short blurb for the public to explore and consume. In this manner, the web map converts internal organizational data into simple point data with corresponding pop-ups for use by donors,
      decisionmakers, and the public. The overall benefit of these tools working in tandem is that once set up, ARC need only edit the Google Sheet with new data as they generate and receive it in order to update the map. Instead of having to create
      a new GeoJSON file everytime more data points are added, Sheet Mapper performs the critical step of generating spatial data with little trouble and maintenance needed. Drawbacks include difficulty in changing the structure or function of the
      web map without knowledge of HTML, CSS, or JavaScript as well as the need to pay Mapbox for widespread sharing and viewing of the map.</p></br>

  <!-- Add information about Data -->
  <div>
    <p style="font-weight:600; font-size:25px; width: 1000px">The Data</p>
    <p>The data is sourced from the American Red Cross's <a href="https://www.redcross.org/about-us/our-work/disaster-relief/hurricane-relief.html">Hurricane Relief</a> website under the heading Recent Hurricane and Typhoon Relief Efforts. In this
      section of the webpage, there are links to pages with information about the assistance ARC has provided in the wake of a particular hurricane. Linked out from these pages are PDF documents giving long-term updates (six months, one year, or two
      years typically) that include numbers of people helped and resources distributed. These documents were manually searched for information regarding meals and snacks served, relief items distributed, overnight shelter stays provided, households
      given financial assistance, and amount of overall financial assistance given to affected households. These data were collected in <b><a
          href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mHMKTTP1koXxcotgoGsoxS540_n7b5ItwQ5U57yDXjQ/edit?usp=sharing">this Google Sheet</a></b>, that links to the above web map.</p>
    <p>While the data are real, their collection into this Google Sheet was performed specifically to demonstrate how this information can be used with spatial data to increase transparency for the organization. The GeoJSON generated from the Google
      Sheet using csv2geojson is a file with point data of where each hurricane first made landfall in the United States. To properly realize the prototype, ARC employees would need to input the name and year of the hurricane as well as the latitude
      and longitude. The location in plain English, link to the ARC site, and additional information are used to build the pop-up. The layout of the spreadsheet is meant to be as simple as possible, so that users could easily enter new data points as
      well as their corresponding features. It is clear that ARC tracks and maintains information on its disaster relief for reporting purposes; this tool would be a way to collate and repurpose this information. The advantages of using a Google
      Sheet are primarily the ease of use and conversion into a GeoJSON. The limitations lie in the inability for point data to capture the swath of area affected by a hurricane, especially when a relief response must span all the way from the
      Caribbean to the United States.</p></br>
