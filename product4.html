  <p> Surveys are a valuable tool for disaster mitigation, response, and recovery. A survey with spatial features can be particularly helpful for the American Red Cross. By introdcuing this geographic element, decision-makers can better understand
    where there is the most need and administer aid more efficiently. ArcGIS Survey 123 is a relatively easy way to create surveys for the general public and for mobile data collection. More information on the application can be found <a
      href="https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/survey123/overview"> here </a> These surveys can be crafted for different audience levels. The interface is very user-friendly, which can also help create surveys quickly for faster response
    times to disasters. These surveys can also be embedded within an already existing website or be sent out directly using a simple link.
    <br>
    <br>
    There is also a spatial data collection aspect of this application, which can be applied to data collection by ARC team members. Because Survey 123 is associated with ArcGIS, data can be easily viewed within other ESRI softwares. In the sample
    survey below, you can see that you can drop pins to collect spatial data. For even more spatial data collection options, a <a href="https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/portal/10.5/use/geoform.html"> GeoForm </a>, another ESRI tool, could also be
    used.

    Below is a sample survey created using Survey 123, showing some of the features that are available and giving examples of how the questions could be used by both internal data collection and surveys for the general public.
