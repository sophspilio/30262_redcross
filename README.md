# American Red Cross: Disaster Mitigation through Web Mapping

This repository is a final project for Clark University's IDCE 30262 Web Mapping and Open Source GIS course created by Thomas Bilintoh, Kyle Pecsok, Shannon Reault, Jess Strzempko, and Sophie Spiliotopoulos. The repository hosts [a website](https://sophspilio.github.io/30262_redcross/index.html) that demonstrates how the American Red Cross could potentially use web mapping to explore datasets, share information with the public, and tellthe story of their work. We welcome you to explore the site and the products within.

**Note that this site was created for the final project of IDCE 30262: Web Mapping and Open-Source GIS and is not affiliated with the American Red Cross.**
