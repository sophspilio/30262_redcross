  <p>This prototype was created using <b><a href="https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-storymaps/get-started/what-is-arcgis-storymaps.htm">ArcGIS Online Story Maps</a></b>. We chose to utilize this format to “tell a story” about where the ARC is working and
    what they are doing because it allows for interactive web maps to be integrated into a narrative format, as well as different forms of media. In creating the web maps for this product, a <b><a
      href='https://clarku.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=d053e72aabfd4c5ab4139c3829c1e11c'>hurricane track dataset</a></b> (lines) created by NOAA was added through <b><a href="https://livingatlas.arcgis.com/en/browse/#d=2">ArcOnline’s Living Atlas</a></b>,
    which is a collection of ready-to-use geographic datasets provided by ESRI. This dataset was utilized in the first map, depicting the spatial distribution, frequency, and severity of hurricanes in 1950 and 2020, visualized using a swipe-map
    format for easy comparison. The hurricane tracks were also used in the second map to highlight the hurricanes of interest in the narrative- Laura, Sally, and Delta. The third spatial element within this product is in the form of a map tour. This
    allows for a chronological depiction of the hurricanes, the location of their landfalls, and where the ARC was stationed (point data). Map tours also have a panel for media, where interviews and news stories about each storm and the ARC
    involvement are provided. The scrolling text panel also allows for key information to be highlighted with each new location within the map tour.

    There are many advantages to using ArcGIS Story Maps for narrative geospatial products. First of all, they are highly customizable; essentially all elements of the map symbology and web page design can be altered by the user. For the purposes of
    this story map, a customized theme was created for the story map page in order to incorporate the ARC color scheme. Furthermore, the interface for creating story maps is very user friendly and intuitive. There are some disadvantages to using this
    story map platform. First of all, an ArcOnline account is required to make a product, which does cost money unless provided through an institution. Furthermore, a point system is used in order to perform certain geospatial techniques or use
    certain datasets, which is tied to the level of account you purchase. Lastly, ArcOnline does not have all of the capabilities of ArcGIS Desktop, which limits the level of geospatial analysis the user can utilize. In general, it is a strong tool
    for walking through a narrative with map and media elements, however it is not the most accessible option.
