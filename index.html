  <p>The American Red Cross organization has and continues to provide tools and services concerning emergency assistance, disaster relief, and disaster preparedness. This project aims to produce tools that will unequivocally communicate the link
    between the services and tools the American Red Cross organization provides. Specifically, this project uses three (3) different but linked web map products to show the link between climate change and the American Red Cross organization's
    humanitarian services within the USA. Below is a summary of each of the three web map products:</p>
  <p>1. A short description of Kyle’s product.</p>
  <p>2. Product 2 is a webmap built with Mapbox GL JS. The purpose of this product is to aid in project coordination and provide users quantitative information regarding ARC's disaster relief response to past hurricane events. This product is meant
    to bridge the gap between Products 1 and 3 by moving beyond raw datasets toward quantitative analyses while still refraining from adding a contextual, narrative element. The goal of this product is to allow the public to see where ARC is working
    and how they are addressing emergency and long-term recovery needs for individuals and families they serve.</p>
  <p>3. Product 3 is in the form of an ArcGIS Story Map. The purpose of this product is to highlight recent efforts of the ARC pertaining to disaster relief following hurricanes in the Gulf Coast region. This allows viewers to create connections
    between the ARC and small communities, as interviews with residents, ARC volunteers, and local news stories are incorporated. Maps included in this product describe storm trends over the past 50 years, major hurricanes in 2020, and locations of
    ARC’s
    on-the-ground relief work.</p>
  <p>4. Product 4 is a sample survey using Survey123, showing just one possible way the American Red Cross can integrate spatial data into their surveys and mobile data collection. The product includes a link to the sample survey and a more detailed
    description of possible uses of the product.</p>
  <p>Each product page includes a detailed description of the product and how it can be used to help the efforts of the American Red Cross.</p>
